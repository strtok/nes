Introduction
============

This is a pet project with the goal of learning some things about 
the NES, and more notable the 6502, while learning a bit more about 
the state of javascript and testing frameworks on nodejs.

The 6502 core is well unit tested, and also acceptance tested with 
the included nestest.rom. The rom is exeecuted by the test runner 
and each instruction's execution is compared against a known good 
run from another emulator in nesttest_log.js

Introduction
============

This was a winter cabin project with the goal of learning some things about 
the NES, and more notably the 6502. 

The 6502 core is well unit tested, and also acceptance tested with 
the included nestest.rom. nesttest.rom nestdev.com The rom is exeecuted 
by the test runner and each instruction's execution is compared against 
a log produced by another emulator known to have precise emulation.
